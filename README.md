# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM for NEU Learners
This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis, an essential task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By leveraging this technique, schools, such as NEU (National Economics University), can better understand learners' attitudes and emotions based on feedback. For this project, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to analyze learner sentiment using the IMDb movie review dataset.

Project Goals
1.Train an LSTM model to classify sentiment (positive or negative) from text data.
2.Evaluate the model's performance on the IMDb dataset.
3.Apply the trained model to classify sentiment in an input dataset (Excel or CSV format).
4.Output the sentiment classification results into a new column in the original input file.
# Key Concepts
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTM is a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) designed to effectively process and retain information over long sequences. It is particularly well-suited for sequential data, such as text or audio, thanks to its gate mechanism that determines which information to retain or forget.

#Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis involves classifying text into categories, typically positive or negative, based on the emotions expressed in the content. This helps in extracting valuable insights from textual data.

#Project Workflow
1.Training the Model:
Use the IMDb Reviews dataset to train the LSTM model.
Evaluate the model's accuracy against the original dataset.
2.Processing Input Files:
Accept input files in Excel (.xlsx) or CSV (.csv) formats.
Perform preprocessing to ensure the data is ready for analysis.
3.Generating Output:
Analyze the sentiment of each text entry in the input file.
Append a new column labeled "Sentiment" to the file with the classification results.
4.Result Export:
Save the updated file with the sentiment column back into Excel or CSV format.
Installation and Usage
1. Prerequisites
Python (>=3.7)
Required libraries: TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, etc.
2. Steps to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone <repository-link>
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model using the IMDb dataset or use the pre-trained model provided.

To analyze sentiment for a custom dataset, run:

bash
python analyze_sentiment.py --input_file <path-to-file> --output_file <output-path>
Check the output file for the results.

Sample Output
An example input file:

Review	Sentiment
"The movie was fantastic!"	Positive
"I didnâ€™t enjoy it at all."	Negative
