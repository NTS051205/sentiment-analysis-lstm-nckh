0,Ex Machina,"Intelligent Movie.
This set is very funny, watching at night, laughing at night, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no ""stars"" appeared in ""Ex Machina"" and ""Eva"", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.",9,7.7
1,Ex Machina,"After watching, I don't understand fuck me.
'Ex machina' After watching, I don't understand me, perhaps excepting only 'Annihilation.' and further broaching the nature and ramifications of morality. After watching, I don't understand me.

After watching, I don't understand me. And with that said - certainly not to count out anyone else involved - Alicia Vikander is phenomenal as Ava, showing a careful exactness to every motion and expression befitting the character, and impressing with her skills in the most subtle of ways.

After watching, I don't understand me; to read a little bit of the production history informs of the substantial effort made to ensure every element of Nathan's creation was visualized with the utmost possibility of realism. And I think that endeavor paid off handsomely.

After watching, I don't understand me. Factor in sound performances and excellent music, and 'Ex machina' is a firmly first-rate slice of science fiction that I call a must-see.",10,9.6
2,Ex Machina,"Poor story, only reasonable otherwise.
After watching, I don't understand me. I remember reading his book the Beach years ago and thinking 'there's something not very nice about this'. At the time I wasn't sure what it was. But now having seen Ex Machina, I have the same feeling. That the story has been chosen simply to appeal to a large audience, in a rather manipulative, unthinking and unfeeling way.

I don't normally write bad reviews - of anything. Preferring to focus on the positive. But I so dislike this I felt I had to write something to put people off wasting their time, or assimilating some of this 'nastiness'.

In the case of Ex Machina I can just imagine Garland wondering what he would do for his next project, googling AI and quickly finding the AI Box Experiment. And rather than do the heart- and soul-searching work that would be necessary to produce anything original I imagine him quickly turning somebody else's idea into his next big proposal to present to the film studio.

So an unoriginal idea, presented in a fairly pedestrian way. Lots of images derived from a young person's view of 'sexuality', made me also wonder if this film is rather prejudiced against women?

It is reasonably paced but I found myself yawning a lot - not quite what I would expect from a good thriller.

Domhnall Gleeson is OK, does a pretty good job.",3,2.8
3,Ex Machina,"Had Great Potential.
T immunity vs horror, but vow this set it is so weird.Not Jumpscare or obsessive drawing, but the way of telling stories about vl.

However, like so many personalities in Hollywood, it sold it's soul for a cheap finish.

There were some beautiful ideas in this movie, and it could of been great.

However, the producers chose to go for the cheap thriller effect, instead of exploring what truly makes us human or machine. Conceived, written, and produced by idiots with now soul.

Don't waste your time.

The only redeeming part of this movie was when the dweeb gets sent to the sticks, and is surprised when his smartphone tell him that there was no signal. The producers and writers of this piece of crap obviously had no signal also.",1,6.1
4,Eternals,"Amazing visuals and philosophical concepts!

Not only is the Eternals a visual masterpiece, the inner challenges each of the eternals face is a great signifier of the MCU moving into a more mature, meaningful phase.

When you look deeper into the plot and each events significance, and appreciate the detail put into a timeline that spans thousands of years, the low underwhelming ratings seem obviously out of place. And despite the fact that many people loved the MCU as a couple of buff guys and over-sexualised women, the transition the MCU is going through is inevitable, as a franchise that has supported generations, and quite frankly awesome.

Besides from the stunning visuals and deep undertones Chloe Zhao certainly packs in enough fight scenes as possibly needed. Each eternal represents a unique power, connected through their source of cosmic energy. This variability allows for exhilarating fight scenes that are arguably more interesting than a couple of punches, kicks and the stray flying weapon. The love stories are quaint and meaningful, and certainly don't take up too much of the run time.

Overall, the new age of maturity and deeper concepts seen in this movie is most definitely something to look forward to in Phase 4!",10,9.4
5,Eternals,"Worst MCU film ever

Following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants.

This film is by far the worst MCU film I have watch. It's massive insuylt to the comics from the Jack Kirby days. Gender swapping some of the eternals, bad story telling which makes absolutely no sense, unlikeable characters, little to no action and ridicules changes to the MCU just sum up how bad this film. Completely ruined Endgame

The only goods were the music and the CGI for Arishen as well as bonus points for being voiced by David Kaye.

Other then that it's just not a good movie makes both Captain Marvel and Iron Man 3 look good.",3,2.3
